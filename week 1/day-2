Task to set up a Medicine Reminder Agent using n8n, which sends automated reminders via Slack or Telegram (whichever is more suitable or available).

Key Requirements:
The user should receive a medicine reminder at scheduled times (e.g., daily at 8 AM and 8 PM).
The reminders should be sent as messages through either Slack or Telegram.
There should be an easy way to update the reminder schedule or stop the reminders if needed.
Ideally, logs or a simple history of sent reminders should be tracked within n8n for reference.

Please go ahead and:
Choose and connect the preferred messaging platform (Slack or Telegram).
Build a simple flow in n8n to schedule and send the reminder messages.
Test it with a sample user and confirm the delivery.
